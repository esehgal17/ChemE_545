# ChemE_545
My repo for ChemE 545 for uploading homework.

To run the scripts, paste each one into its own cell in a jupyter notebook that uses and python kernel. 

To execute extract_parameter.py, run: print(extract_parameter("distillation_column", "temperature", 1))

To execute calculate_solution_weights.py, run: print(calculate_solution_weights(molecular_weights, solutions_needed))

Comments are written throughout the code detailing what each line does.
